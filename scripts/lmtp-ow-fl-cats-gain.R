# "SL.earth" refers to a wrapper for the 'earth' function from the 'earth' R package in the SuperLearner library. This function implements Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), a non-parametric regression method that extends linear models by allowing for interactions and non-linear relationships between variables.
# MARS models can handle high-dimensional data well and can be a useful tool for capturing complex patterns in the data. They work by fitting piecewise linear models to the data, which allows for flexible and potentially non-linear relationships between predictors and the outcome.
